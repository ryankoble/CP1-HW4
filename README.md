1.  The for loop runs as many times as can fit within the width ( -10 on the left and right ).
    This equals 38 times because the width is 400 pixels and each line is drawn every 10 pixels,
    minus 20 pixels because of the -10 from the width.
2.  The first 10 sets the starting point to 10 pixels from 0, the second 10 sets it so that it
    stops 10 pixels from the width on either side, and the third causes it to add 10 pixels to
    the x-axis each line that is drawn.
3.  A for loop that draws 100 pixels a frame 100 times would make 10,000 points on the canvas.
4.  Spacing can be increased either by increasing the amount that is added in the third part of
    the for loop, or by increasing the amount in the splice function.
5.  The ellipse trail can be made longer by changing both of the value inside of the slice functions.
